This includes minting and burning. If {ERC721Consecutive} is\n used, the hook may be called as part of a consecutive (batch) mint, as indicated by `batchSize` greater than 1.\n Calling conditions:\n - When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, ``from``'s tokens were transferred to `to`.\n - When `from` is zero, the tokens were minted for `to`.\n - When `to` is zero, ``from``'s tokens were burned.\n - `from` and `to` are never both zero.\n - `batchSize` is non-zero.\n To learn more about hooks, head to xref:ROOT:extending-contracts.adoc#using-hooks[Using

module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.

Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry points to them.
